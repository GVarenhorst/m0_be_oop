# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
    It was really daunting, but fun. There were a lot of "what do I do now" moments, followed by trial and error and then enlightenment. It was fun. I really overthought the first problem, but the next problems built in complexity on each other.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.? 
    It still needs work. When I'm focused, I want to stay focused, and breaks only seem like a good idea when I'm at a temporary impasse. As I get more fluid in my workflow I will hold myself to breaks better.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1? 
    Try it, learn from terminal responses, try again. Test often, and build code in chunks.
